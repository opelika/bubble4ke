# Nobelium
Nobelium source, MPL-2.0.

A web server for older versions of the Rocorp client. **[Here's a tl;dr of the license.](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mozilla-public-license-2.0-(mpl-2))** Fork and PR away! There is no specific code style because the project is already messy.

This repo contains zero copyrighted-by-Rocorp code. It's like rAthena, but for that one game made by them! Uses Laravel 5.3.
